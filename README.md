Homework 2 for the Georgia Tech Professional Education Data Science and Analytics BootCamp. This project took multiple stock's price data over time and extracted the following:
  - Annual change in trading price for each stock
  - Percent change in trading price for each stock
  - Total trading volume for that calendar year for each stock

There were additional, optional data points that were requested. They are:
  - Stock with the greatest percent increase in trading price for each calendar year
  - Stock with the greatest percent decrease in trading price for each calendar year
  - Stock with the greatest trading volume for each calendar year
